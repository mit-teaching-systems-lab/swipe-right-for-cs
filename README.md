A game for teachers to practice empathizing with young people and authentically connecting their strengths and interests to computer science.

To develop locally:
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

This will run the server and the create-react-app development server in parallel, writing the output of both to stdout.

Note that the site is responsive and will include a fake frame for an iPhone 5 running Safari at desktop resolution.

To develop on device:
```
$ yarn run grok
```

Then open that URL on your phone.
